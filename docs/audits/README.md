# Audit archive (curated)

These are the human-readable audit and remediation artifacts for TradePulse Pro, kept
in-repo so judges can read them without cloning the raw evidence tree. Every HTML file is
**self-contained** (screenshots embedded; no network needed) and opens by double-click.

## Where the raw evidence lives

Full-resolution screenshots, HAR-class network/console dumps, JSON result sets and the
independent QA-round scripts stay in the local working tree (`evidence/`, `doc/`), which is
intentionally git-ignored. Nothing in this folder links to those paths, so no link here can
break. The curated reports above embed the before/after images they reference.

## Reproducing the checks

- App test suites: `npx tsc -b`, `npx vitest run`, `python tests/test_tradepulse.py`, `python tests/verify_setup.py`.
- Live verification harness: [`../../scripts/qa/`](../../scripts/qa/) (requires Chrome/Edge and the live deployment; see its README).
